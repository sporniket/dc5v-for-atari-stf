## 1. What is **DC5V for the Atari STF**, and when to use it ?

**DC5V for the Atari STF** is an alternative pcb to replace the integrated power supply of the Atari STf, based on the premise that the original power plug will receive a DC 5V, 3~4A supply instead of being plugged to the main grid (110~240V, 50~60Hz, 1A).
